solLog
====
A small app that acts like a digital diary.

It currently has a system in place to upload log entries, with an author, title and entry. However, the login system currently isn't working and there is no system in place to search for previous log entries.

The packages that this app currently uses are:
+ orchestrate
+ socket.io
+ express
+ any dependencies the above require
